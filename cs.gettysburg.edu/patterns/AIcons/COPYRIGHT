DESKTOP TEXTURES

Desktop Textures is an on-going graphic arts/software project of Stephen
Krauth and Geoff Adams, one of several such projects at Avernus.  The xpm
files in this directory are derived from the textures we've created for
display on the Macintosh desktop.  You can find the current release of the
Desktop Textures distribution for the Macintosh on the Glue anonymous ftp
site ftp.eng.umd.edu in the pub/avernus directory.  This is a MacBinary
file.  If you prefer to transfer a BinHex file, you can find one on the
Info Mac ftp site sumex-aim.stanford.edu.

There are currently three complete volumes of textures and one 24-bit
supplement.  This directory contains only some of them.  As time allows,
we'll be filling this directory with the rest of the textures.

You can display these patterns on your X display with your favourite
bitmap/pixmap viewer, such as xv.  You can also set one of our textures to
be your X root window background:

* If you use tvtwm, you can set the VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap and
  PannerBackgroundPixmap variables each to the filename of one of these
  textures.

* If you use another window manager, you can place a command in your
  .xsession file that says something like:  "xloadimage -onroot filename".

These images are not for use with the Microsoft Windows environment.  Using
these patterns in a Windows environment consitutes a copyright violation.
All other use and further distribution requires that we are credited with
creation of the textures.  Obtain our permission prior to redistribution in
any form other than this entire package as you find it here.

You may reach the creators of these textures at the following address:
